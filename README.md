# ActiverecordActivityTracker
`activerecord_activity_tracker` provides simple yet powerful activity tracker for your Rails **ActiveRecord** models.

This gem will allows you to create the data model for social **news feed** used in many modern platform in no time.

`Note:` This is an abstract gem, thus there are no views or controllers provided.











### Features
- Track model's creation and/or updating activities. 
- Track any custom activity's event easily.
- Add optional data to any custom activity.
- Set owner once, and use it in all tracked models seamlessly.
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
## Usage

### Track a model
- Include `ActiverecordActivityTracker::ActsAsTrackable`
- For automatic tracking add `acts_as_trackable`
- For custom event use `create_ar_activity`

### Set default owner (user)
- Include `ActiverecordActivityTracker::Owner`
- To set the owner use `set_owner(current_user)`
- To get the owner use `get_owner`
- To clear owner use `clear_owner`

`Note:` setting the owner is required, as each activity must have an owner, see [set default owner example](#set-default-owner-to-devise-current_user)
 

### Access model's tracked activities
- Include `ActiverecordActivityTracker::ActsAsTrackable`
- Use `ar_activities`

### Examples

#### Track comment's creation
```ruby
# app/models/comment.rb
class Comment < ApplicationRecord
  include ActiverecordActivityTracker::ActsAsTrackable

  acts_as_trackable [:create]
end
 ```
 
#### Track comment's creation and modification
```ruby
# app/models/comment.rb
class Comment < ApplicationRecord
  include ActiverecordActivityTracker::ActsAsTrackable

  acts_as_trackable [:create, :update]
end
 ``` 

#### Track comment's custom event (title's change)

```ruby
# app/models/comment.rb
class Comment < ApplicationRecord
  include ActiverecordActivityTracker::ActsAsTrackable

  after_update :add_title_change_activity
    
  private
    
  def add_title_change_activity
    create_ar_activity(key: 'comment.title.change') if saved_change_to_title?
  end
    
end
 ``` 

#### Set default owner to devise current_user
`Note:` owner is a polymorphic relation, thus any model can be used, not just user.
 
```ruby
# app/controllers/application_controller.rb
class ApplicationController < ActionController::Base
  include ActiverecordActivityTracker::Owner

  protect_from_forgery with: :exception

  around_action :set_ar_activity_owner


  private

  def set_ar_activity_owner
    set_owner current_user
    yield
  ensure
    clear_owner
  end

end
```

### Access comment's activities

```html
<!-- app/views/comments/show.erb -->
  <% @comment.ar_activities.each do |activity| %>
      <%= activity.key %>
      <br>
  <% end %>
```
